# face-blurring
Python script for detecting and blurring faces in images using OpenCV."

**Prerequisites:**
- Python installed on your system.
- OpenCV installed (you can install it using `pip install opencv-python`).

**Usage:**

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the `face_blurring.py` script.

2. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the script by entering the following command:

     ```bash
     python face_blurring.py
     ```

3. **Provide the Image Path**:
   - The script will prompt you to enter the path to the image file that contains the face you want to blur.
   - Enter the full path to the image file, and press Enter.

4. **Face Blurring**:
   - The script will detect faces in the provided image and apply a blur effect to each detected face.

5. **Save the Result**:
   - After processing, the script will save the resulting image with blurred faces as "output_image.jpg" in the same directory where the script is located.

6. **Completion Message**:
   - You will see a message indicating that the face blurring process is completed.

That's it! You can now check the directory for the "output_image.jpg" file, which contains the image with the faces blurred.
